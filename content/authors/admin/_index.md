üëã Hi everyone, I'm siruzhong, currently an **MPhil** student at **HKUST(GZ)**, supervised by [Yuxuan Liang](http://yuxuanliang.com/), where I explore Spatio-Temporal Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Intelligent Transportation, and Smart Cities. Our lab is called CityMind, we are dedicated to shaping the future of AI/DM for Spatio-Temporal Data, and you can access it at [citymind.top](https://citymind.top)!

Before that, I am a **Background R&D Engineer**. I started as a summer intern and eventually joined Tencent full-time for a year. During my time there, I worked on various projects related to <u>CloudDev</u>, <u>EventBus</u>, <u>DevOps</u>, and <u>Engineering Efficiency</u>, focusing on developing and optimizing cloud development tools, event-driven communication systems, and improving engineering productivity.

ü§ó I'm eager to learn, grow, and share insights with all of you here. If you have any questions or specific topics you'd like to discuss, please feel free to reach out!
