üëã Hi everyone, I'm siruzhong, a former Backend RD Engineer at Tencent. I started as a summer intern and eventually joined Tencent full-time for a year. During my time there, I worked on various projects related to CloudDev, EventBus, DevOps, and Engineering Efficiency üí™, focusing on developing and optimizing cloud development tools, event-driven communication systems, and improving engineering productivity.

üí° Currently, I'm a research assistant at the HKUST(GZ), where I explore spatiotemporal data science, artificial intelligence, intelligent transportation, and smart cities. It's an exciting opportunity to contribute to the advancement of knowledge in these fields.

ü§ó I'm eager to learn, grow, and share insights with all of you here. If you have any questions or specific topics you'd like to discuss, please feel free to reach out!
